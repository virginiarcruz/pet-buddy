I have FeLV, or Feline leukemia virus. FeLV is a contagious, viral disease of cats and is most commonly spread via the saliva of infected cats, either directly or by contaminated items such as food and water dishes or toys. Treatment consists of good nourishment, protection from stress, and management of secondary conditions. There is no treatment that has been shown to be effective in curing FeLV infection. Clinical signs when the cat is succumbing to the virus and its effects are highly variable. To reduce spread to other cats and kittens, this animal needs to be housed indoors only. Any medical care related to this condition will be the express responsibility of the adopter. We sincerely appreciate adopters that are willing to provide special homes for FELV cats and we gladly waive the adoption fee.\r\n\n<script src=\"https://www.adoptmeapp.org/js/widget.js\"></script>\n<div style=\"max-width: 440px;
